#BASU NAO ROBOTIC

In this step the robot is intended to walk straight accross the CE corridor and gather data from different devices including:

1. Laser: This sensor which is installed on NAO's head is supposed to gather continuous data during walk.

2. Sonar: This sensor gets the raw data collected and also another pre-written method that reports if there is something on left and right hand of the robot.

3. Camera: A image or video will be collected and store for further detailed information.

4. Pose: there might be further calculation need for pose to estimate the displacement.
